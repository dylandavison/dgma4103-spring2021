      <figcaption><strong>Covid helped me buy this thing. I got a job at a factory inbetween semesters and they were incredibly behind since they had to close for a bit. I was hired right when they were trying to catch up so we were working 60 hour weeks. It was awful, but we were getting 20 hours overtime. This allowed me to make insane money in a a very short amount of time. That work got me this. I like it.  </strong></figcaption>
